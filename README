Family Directory links family members by their parents and spouse to form a family tree

This applicatin requires the use of a mysql database with certain tables. The file setup.sql contains the script to set them up. **Note** The file setup.sql does not setup a "test" user. You need to manually set the information for the first person in the family manually.

It also uses the Smarty Template Engine. Smarty files can be kept anywhere in the file structure but the file '/php/tpl_setup.php' should be edited to point to that location.

User's profile pictures are coded to be stored in '/images/faces/'

Currently only the ancestor tree is visible. There is code to display the descendant trees but the alignment of the user tiles is not correct and so I disabled the link.

1) Add the descendant trees
2) Implement a 'click-to-edit' UX on the showuser page. This will eliminate the need for the edituser page. I have played around with this and as a result so javascript and php code has been left in scripts.js and showuser.tpl
